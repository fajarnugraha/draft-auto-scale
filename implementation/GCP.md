# GCP Implementation of Auto-Scaling Requirements

This document describes how Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services, primarily the **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**, can be used to meet the generic auto-scaling requirements.

GCP can fulfill all the specified requirements for auto-scaling containerized applications. GKE, a managed Kubernetes service, provides the core components for a robust and flexible auto-scaling strategy. For the most hands-off approach, **GKE Autopilot** mode manages the underlying nodes and cluster scaling automatically.

## 1. Application Scaling

### 1.1. Containerization

- **Container Support:** GKE is a conformant Kubernetes service, with native support for running industry-standard Docker containers.
- **Supported Runtimes:** GKE is language-agnostic. Any application that can be containerized, including **Go** and **JavaScript (Node.js)**, can be run and scaled on GKE.

### 1.2. Scaling Dimensions

GKE provides sophisticated mechanisms for horizontal scaling.

- **Horizontal Scaling:** This is achieved using the **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**. The HPA automatically adjusts the number of pod replicas in a Deployment or ReplicaSet based on observed metrics, directly fulfilling the requirement.

### 1.3. Scaling Triggers

GKE can trigger scaling events based on a wide variety of metrics.

- **Resource-Based Scaling:** The HPA natively supports scaling based on **CPU Utilization** and **Memory Utilization**. This is a standard and widely used configuration.

- **Request-Based Scaling:** The HPA can scale based on custom and external metrics.
    - **Request Count:** Metrics like requests-per-second (RPS) can be collected from the GKE Ingress controller and fed into the HPA via the Custom Metrics API, which is backed by **Google Cloud Monitoring**.
    - **Request Latency:** Similarly, latency metrics from the load balancer can be used as a custom metric to trigger scaling events.

- **Schedule-Based Scaling:** While Kubernetes does not have a native "Scheduled Pod Autoscaler," this is commonly implemented by using a Kubernetes **CronJob**. The CronJob runs at a specified schedule and executes a command (e.g., using `kubectl`) to patch the `minReplicas` and `maxReplicas` fields of the HPA object, effectively creating a scheduled scaling event.

- **Event-Driven Scaling:** This is achieved by integrating **KEDA (Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling)** with GKE. KEDA is an open-source component that can scale workloads based on metrics from various event sources, including **Google Cloud Pub/Sub**, and works by driving the HPA.

## 2. Scaling Performance

### 2.1. Time-to-Scale

The time-to-scale in GKE is a combination of Pod auto-scaling (HPA) and cluster-level scaling (Cluster Autoscaler).

- **Scale-Up Time:**
    1.  The HPA controller checks metrics every 15 seconds by default and reacts quickly to create new pods when a threshold is breached.
    2.  If there is not enough capacity on existing nodes, the **Cluster Autoscaler (CA)** is triggered to provision a new node.
    3.  The time to provision a new VM node, pull the container image, and start the container typically takes a few minutes. This process can be significantly accelerated by using **GKE Autopilot** or by configuring node pool settings and using smaller, optimized container images. The 5-minute requirement is generally achievable.

- **Scale-Down Time:** The HPA has a configurable stabilization window (defaulting to 5 minutes) to prevent rapid scale-down events. The Cluster Autoscaler will also safely drain and terminate underutilized nodes after a configurable period (typically 10 minutes). These settings can be tuned to meet specific cost and availability requirements.

### 2.2. Cooldown Periods

The HPA in GKE has built-in, configurable cooldown and stabilization periods. The `--horizontal-pod-autoscaler-downscale-stabilization` flag (configurable in the GKE control plane) allows for setting a specific cooldown period for scale-down events, preventing thrashing.

## 3. Configuration and Management

- **Declarative Configuration:** All GKE and Kubernetes resources, including Deployments and HPAs, are configured using declarative **YAML** files, fully supporting infrastructure-as-code (IaC) practices.
- **API and CLI Access:** GCP provides the **`gcloud` CLI** for managing GKE clusters, and Kubernetes provides the **`kubectl` CLI** for managing workloads within the cluster. Both are backed by comprehensive REST APIs.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** **Google Cloud's operations suite (formerly Stackdriver)** provides deep, out-of-the-box integration with GKE. It automatically collects logs, events, and metrics, including detailed information on all auto-scaling activities, for comprehensive monitoring and auditing.

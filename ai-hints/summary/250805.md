# Project Summary & Resumption Guide (2025-08-05)

## 1. Project Objective
To define and document a comprehensive set of requirements for a cloud-native auto-scaling solution and provide implementation guides for various platforms.

## 2. Current Status
We have established the core requirements for a horizontal auto-scaling system, covering containerization, scaling triggers, performance, and management.

We have created implementation guides for:
- A generic Kubernetes cluster.
- Google Cloud Platform (GKE).

These guides include two detailed case studies that explore different scaling strategies:
- **Online Shop Flash Sale:** Focuses on proactive, scheduled scaling combined with reactive scaling.
- **Online Test Platform:** Introduces the complexities of stateful applications, session persistence, and the need for event-driven scaling to handle unpredictable, tenant-driven load.

We have also documented procedures for testing and monitoring the system.

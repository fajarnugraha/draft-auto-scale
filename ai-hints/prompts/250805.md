This file contains a log of the user prompts from the Gemini CLI session.

---

### Prompt 1
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-05T09:48:42.008Z

create REQUIREMENT.md
- describing generic requirement for a cloud provider to support auto scale feature
- based on what is currently avaibale (e.g. at GCP, AWS, etc)
- use generic terms whenever possible
- start with app scaling using containers. golang and javascript. ignore external components like db for now
- specify how long it takes until load exceed a certain threshold until auto scale completes so that the load falls under another threshold

---

### Prompt 2
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-05T09:51:01.320Z

in the future, ALWAYS ask before commit. You wrote like you asked, but didn't wait for my response

---

### Prompt 3
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-05T09:52:30.324Z

is the requirement implementable? create implementation/GCP.md on how GCP can implement that

---

### Prompt 4
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-05T09:53:52.630Z

only focus on horizontal scaling for now. update requirement and implementation

---

### Prompt 5
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-05T09:54:33.686Z

yes

---

### Prompt 6
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-05T09:55:09.552Z

create implementation/K8S.md on how it can be implemented using generic k8s

---

### Prompt 7
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-05T09:55:44.338Z

yes

---

### Prompt 8
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-05T09:58:57.371Z

create case examples on REQUIREMENT. Then write the implementation (starting with implementation/K8S). Start with on online shop holding a flash sale. Use these assumption:
- it will start a certain time -> how the implementation support schedule scaling?
- number of visitors on flash sale time is estimated 100x normal
- i want a reasonable threshold and time. Not too long, user will leave if (e.g.) then can't access the site for 5 minutes. Make sensible choice based on the use case

---

### Prompt 9
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-05T10:01:16.652Z

- you don't have reactive scale down. is that intentional?
- is 75% and 2 minutes reasonable?

---

### Prompt 10
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-05T10:02:53.590Z

ok, commit it

---

### Prompt 11
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-05T10:03:16.137Z

yes

---

### Prompt 12
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-05T10:05:07.928Z

add to requirement how to test and monitor that it works. a load generator? dashboard that monitors load and number of pods?

if it will be the same, create a dedicated page have others refer it (e.g. implementation/load-generator/NAME-OF-GENERATOR.md
if each cloud will have different things, then just put it inside their respective page (K8S, GCP, etc)

---

### Prompt 13
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-05T10:06:51.820Z

yes

---

### Prompt 14
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-05T10:07:44.697Z

since we have implementation/load-generator, does it make sense to have implementation/cloud-provider diretory? adjust the name if needed

---

### Prompt 15
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-05T10:08:35.372Z

yes

---

### Prompt 16
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-05T10:10:27.343Z

add reasoning you wrote when i asked about whether 75% is correct. put it as additional explanation in use case (determine correct section). e.g:
- use case: online shop flash sale
- special considerations: (what you wrote about how it only makes sense to scale down when the flash sale ends)

---

### Prompt 17
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-05T10:12:40.177Z

yes

---

### Prompt 18
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-05T10:13:42.780Z

consider an online test platform. does it have the same requirement as flash sale, or is there some unique charasteric for it?

---

### Prompt 19
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-05T10:15:07.802Z

is it also predictable? can't school schedule sudden exams on their own without telling the provider beforehand?

---

### Prompt 20
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-05T10:15:36.964Z

yes

---

### Prompt 21
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-05T10:16:58.480Z

yes

---

### Prompt 22
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-05T10:19:37.123Z

yes

---

### Prompt 23
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-05T10:21:10.801Z

create prompts directory. log my current prompts there in a file with date format (e.g. 250805.md)

---

### Prompt 24
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-05T10:21:31.013Z

how do i get prompt history from gemini cli?

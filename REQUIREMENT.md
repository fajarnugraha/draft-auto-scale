# Generic Requirements for Cloud Provider Auto Scaling

This document outlines the generic requirements for a cloud provider to support auto-scaling features for containerized applications. The requirements are based on existing features in major cloud providers and are intended to be cloud-agnostic.

## 1. Application Scaling

The primary focus of these requirements is on application-level scaling using containers.

### 1.1. Containerization

- **Container Support:** The platform must support running applications in industry-standard containers (e.g., Docker).
- **Supported Runtimes:** The platform should have first-class support for popular programming language runtimes, including **Go** and **JavaScript (Node.js)**.

### 1.2. Scaling Dimensions

The auto-scaling mechanism should support both horizontal and vertical scaling.

- **Horizontal Scaling:**
    - The platform must be able to automatically increase or decrease the number of container instances (replicas) based on demand.
    - This is the primary mechanism for scaling stateless applications.

- **Vertical Scaling:**
    - The platform should provide a mechanism to automatically adjust the resources (CPU, memory) allocated to a container instance.
    - This can be useful for stateful applications or applications with specific resource requirements.

### 1.3. Scaling Triggers

The auto-scaling system should be able to trigger scaling events based on a variety of metrics.

- **Resource-Based Scaling:**
    - **CPU Utilization:** Scale based on the average CPU utilization of all running container instances.
    - **Memory Utilization:** Scale based on the average memory utilization of all running container instances.

- **Request-Based Scaling:**
    - **Request Count:** Scale based on the number of incoming requests per second (RPS) to a load balancer or ingress controller.
    - **Request Latency:** Scale based on the average response time of the application.

- **Schedule-Based Scaling:**
    - The platform must allow for scheduled scaling events to handle predictable traffic patterns (e.g., scaling up during business hours and down at night).

- **Event-Driven Scaling:**
    - The platform should support scaling based on events from other services, such as the number of messages in a queue or tasks in a stream.

## 2. Scaling Performance

The auto-scaling system must be able to react quickly to changes in load to ensure application availability and performance.

### 2.1. Time-to-Scale

- **Scale-Up Time:** When the average load exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., 70% CPU utilization) for a configurable period (e.g., 60 seconds), the auto-scaling system must complete the scale-up operation (i.e., have new container instances ready to serve traffic) within a specified timeframe (e.g., 5 minutes). The goal is to bring the load back below a target threshold (e.g., 50% CPU utilization).

- **Scale-Down Time:** When the average load falls below a predefined threshold (e.g., 30% CPU utilization) for a configurable period (e.g., 300 seconds), the auto-scaling system should gracefully terminate excess container instances. This process should be completed within a specified timeframe (e.g., 5 minutes) to reduce costs, without impacting application availability.

### 2.2. Cooldown Periods

- To prevent rapid fluctuations in the number of instances, the auto-scaling system must support configurable cooldown periods between scaling activities. This prevents the system from launching or terminating instances before the previous scaling activity has had a chance to take effect.

## 3. Configuration and Management

- **Declarative Configuration:** The auto-scaling policies should be definable in a declarative format (e.g., YAML, JSON) to enable infrastructure-as-code practices.
- **API and CLI Access:** The platform must provide a comprehensive API and command-line interface (CLI) for managing auto-scaling configurations.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** The platform must provide detailed monitoring and logging of auto-scaling events to allow for auditing and troubleshooting.
